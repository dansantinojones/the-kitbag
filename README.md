# The Kitbag

## Introduction
This online store was created and developed as my final portfolio project for my Full Stack Software Development course with Code Institute. The Kitbag is an e-commerce website selling retro football shirts. Users can register an account, browse shirts on sale, purchase shirts with card payment, view order history and sell shirts.

## Scope Plane
### User Stories 
### Agile Methodology
The Kitbag was created using the agile approach, from the initial planning and wireframing to building the front and back-end functionalities. I used GitHub project to build a Kanban board to visualise the user stories from ‘To Do’ to ‘In Progress’ to ‘Done’. User Stories that could not be completed were put into ‘Out of Scope’. ’Important’ red tags were used on the User Stories that needed addressing first. ‘Urgent’ yellow tags were used on User Stories that must be included. ‘CRUD’ aqua tags were used to highlight the Admin Stories. 
### Milestones
- Home
- Registration
- Products
- Basket
- Checkout
- Payment 
- Profile 
- Admin

## Structure Plane 
The structure of the pages was carefully planned out when designing the website. I wanted to keep it similar to most e-commerce website structures ensuring that the website is familiar to the user and the content is positioned exactly where the user expects it to be.
### Consistent
### Predictable
- Clickable logo to take user back to home page
- Images open in a new window
### Content Organisation
The shirts on sale were displayed on the site using bootstrap cards which stack nicely above each other in mobile view making it easy to browse through the products.
### Information Architecture 
When planning the shirt detail page I put myself in the shoes of the user to understand what information would be most important to the user and how it will be viewed. The most important information in the buyer decision-making process is, image, name, price and size.

## Skeleton Plane 
### Wireframes
Prior to writing any code, initial wireframes were drawn with pencil and paper. Once happy with the layout and design, I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create my wireframes. It was important to plan and visualise my website across desktop and mobile to ensure I had a clear vision and the execution of writing code was successful.

### Navigation Diagram
I designed a flowchart using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/documents#/documents?folder_id=recent) to help visualise the user experience throughout the website. The milestones are bold to highlight their importance.

## Testing 
### Secret Key
The Django Secret Key was accidentally exposed through GitHub. Since noticing the mistake, I have created a new secret key inside a .env file and hidden it through a gitignore file. The Secret Key exposed in the files does not work as it has since been changed.
